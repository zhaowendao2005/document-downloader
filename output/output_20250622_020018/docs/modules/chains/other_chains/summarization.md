摘要
摘要链可以用来总结多个文档。一种方法是在将多个较小的文档分成块后将它们作为输入，与
MapReduceDocumentsChain
一起操作。您还可以选择将进行摘要的链替换为StuffDocumentsChain，或RefineDocumentsChain。在此处了解有关它们之间差异的更多信息

"In response to Russia's aggression in Ukraine, the United States has united with other freedom-loving nations to impose economic sanctions and hold Putin accountable. The U.S. Department of Justice is also assembling a task force to go after the crimes of Russian oligarchs and seize their ill-gotten gains.",
"The United States and its European allies are taking action to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, including seizing assets, closing off airspace, and providing economic and military assistance to Ukraine. The US is also mobilizing forces to protect NATO countries and has released 30 million barrels of oil from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help blunt gas prices. The world is uniting in support of Ukraine and democracy, and the US stands with its Ukrainian-American citizens.",
" President Biden and Vice President Harris ran for office with a new economic vision for America, and have since passed the American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to help struggling families and rebuild America's infrastructure. This includes creating jobs, modernizing roads, airports, ports, and waterways, replacing lead pipes, providing affordable high-speed internet, and investing in American products to support American jobs.",
